Facts about the vagus nerve

The vagus nerve is the 10th cranial nerve and the longest nerve of the automatic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is our control system and it is responsible for regulating our body function, such as heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate etc. and it consists of two nervous systems, the parasympathetic nervous system (“rest and digest”) and the sympathetic nervous system (“fight or flight”).

The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and consists of two sides, the dorsal (back) side and the ventral (front) side. The fibres of the vagus expand through most of our body, including heart, lungs and digestive tract.

Within the polyvagal theory the dorsal side of the vagus is responsible for the response to danger. In extremely threatening situations, we can even experience a shock or freeze state for self-protection. The ventral side responds to a safe environment and to social interactions. We feel connected to others and physically as well as emotionally safe.
What is the polyvagal theory?

The polyvagal theory explains the complex role of the vagus nerve regarding neural regulation and social behaviour. The theory was introduced 1994 by Stephen W. Porges, Ph.D., who is a Distinguished University Scientist at Indiana University.

Porges describes three developmental circuits of the ANS on how we regulate our physical states and respond to our environment. These circuits are evolutionary and work in a hierarchy way. Here explained from to newest to the oldest:

Social engagement – Social communication

Social engagement is the newest circuits and is a component of the PNS. It belongs to the ventral side of the vagus and responds to connection and safety. We feel calm when we are connected and engaged with others.

Mobilization – Fight or flight

The second circuit in the evolutionary hierarchy, which developed before social engagement is mobilization. Mobilization is a response of the sympathetic nervous system, which enables us to move in dangerous situations. It activates the fight or flight system. 

Immobilization – Feigning death

Immobilization is the oldest circuit and belongs to the dorsal side of the vagus, which activates in extreme dangerous situations. We experience a state of shock or freeze and shut down. Our heart rate drops rapidly and it can even result in a life-threatening bradycardia.

These three circuits are fluid and we oscillate between them during the day. For example, we meet a friend for coffee. We feel socially connected and therefore safe. On our way back home a dog comes running and barking at us. Our body mobilizes us to move quickly because we don’t know the dog’s intention and we want to get out of this dangerous situation. When we are back home with our family we feel safe again and can relax.

In situations of extreme distress, like sexual or physical abuse or other cues that trigger our nervous system our body moves into immobilization, we shut down, freeze or dissociate. That is our body’s response to protect us from experiencing these harmful situations.

When someone has experienced trauma with immobilization it is possible that their system becomes overprotective for future danger cues and puts them directly from social engagement into immobilization. These cues can be as subtle as the tone of a voice, facial expression or body posture etc.
Early childhood and the development of the neural circuits

The ANS is rapidly changing during the last trimester through the first year of an infant’s life to obtain the basic physiological needs to survive. The first month after birth infants are totally dependent on their primary caregiver for physical and emotional regulation (food, protection, proximity).

Besides that, infants are not equipped with a completely myelinated vagal system. Myelination of the vagal fibres improves physical regulation through muscles involved in sucking, swallowing, vocalizing, and breathing.  According to Porges (2011), the functioning of the myelinated vagus is crucial for social behavior. The myelinated vagus makes it easier to regulate the physical needs by ourselves and we have more capacity to engage with others. Without a functioning, myelinated vagus, babies would display more tantrums (mobilization) and shutdown behaviors (immobilization) rather than social behaviour.

Porges (2011) emphasizes that the neural circuits which are involved in regulation of physiological state influences social behavior and our ability to manage challenges. If we couldn’t develop these circuits due to developmental issues or environmental risks, our regulation system is compromised and we might face difficulties to establish social bonds and have problems learning social skills.
