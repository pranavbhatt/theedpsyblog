### Brief Introduction

High sensitivity is a trait of temperament. As part of a person’s personality, temperament is innate and describes the way how humans behave and react to certain situations and environments. The characteristics of temperament are stable over time, biologically based, independent from learning, hard to manipulate, and hard to change. <!--more--> A person’s temperament affects mood, the threshold to stimuli, perseverance, and pace. The definition varies a little from source to source. This means that being a person of high sensitivity isn’t something we choose. It is something we are or we are not and it starts with birth.

Even though the concept of high sensitivity is discussed controversially, there are more and more indicators that being a highly sensitive person isn’t just a psychophysiological construct but a trait. The first who described high sensitivity is the American psychologist couple Aron & Aron. Most of the following is based on their understanding of the trait.

Another term for high sensitivity is sensory processing sensitivity, not to be confused with sensory processing disorder (SPD) or also called sensory integration disorder. SPD is a disorder that affects the processing of stimuli through the senses. There can be overlaps between these two but being highly sensitive is not a disorder per se.
4 Aspects of highly sensitive children

Depth of processing

Highly sensitive children process all impressions they get deeply. This can easily lead to overstimulation. Therefore, these children are slow to warm up. Other side effects of deep processing are difficulties to make decisions due to many possibilities, the tendency to reflect a lot and ask deep questions about the world.

Overstimulation

As mentioned above overstimulation can be a side effect of deep processing and all perceived impressions can become a problem, e.g. complaints about the heat or cold, scratchy clothes or loud noises. But they can also have an aversion for parties, surprises or changes in general.  Overstimulation can lead to lower performance when they are watched or tested. These children are very aware of the facial expressions of other people and social cues.

Emotional overreaction and high empathy

Children with this trait cry easily, have intense emotions and feel the feelings of others deeply. It almost looks like they can read minds. Besides, they can be perfectionists and have intense reactions when they make errors.

Awareness of subtle stimuli

This aspect refers to the children’s ability to notice very subtle changes like furniture has been moved or something small changed in the appearance of a person. They notice a different tone of a voice or slight smell and this can cause problems, e.g. the child refuses to enter a room.
Summary

A child with a strong temperament can be an additional challenge and this can impact family life in many ways. It can also affect school performance of the child when no one knows about this trait.

The concept of high sensitivity makes sense but it is also hard to catch at the same time. There are so many factors involved and lots of children have at least one or two characteristics of high sensitivity but they are not labeled as high sensitive children. Then there are children who behave obviously highly sensitive, because of their intensity and explicit expression of behavior which is associated with high sensitivity. Finally, there are children who are highly sensitive but cope well on their own and therefore, might be misunderstood a lot and get lost. This article is especially for the last group. If we are more aware of this concept we can respond more appropriately to every single child, contribute to their quality of life and help them thrive in every situation.
