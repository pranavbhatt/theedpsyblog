### A brief insight into the beginning of attachment

Attachment is the bonding process between parent* and child, and thus our first experience with relationships. These early experiences are critical in how we see the world, other people and ourselves at the beginning of our life. Every new developmental stage we reach is built on our relationship experience.

Babies come in the world pretty helpless and depend on someone to get his/her needs met. It may seem that the needs are primarily of physical nature like food, hygiene, and protection, which is certainly true, but the psychological aspect is equally important. As a matter of fact, infants don’t know how to cope with all the new experiences they make and therefore need the help of the parent to guide him/her.
5 good reasons why high-quality attachment in early childhood is important

### Survival

As mentioned, babies need someone who can feed them, clean them, dress them and help them to regulate their physical and emotional experiences. Therefore, it’s the first emotion regulation system they learn and the most intense one.

### Brain development

Attachment literally shapes your brain. Repeated early experiences form stable neural pathways. Therefore, quality is essential.

### Resilience later in life

At least one high-quality relationship in early childhood can be a protective factor against upcoming challenges and adversities and foster resilience.

### Influence on relationships as an adult

The attachment style, someone develops as the child will be repeated in the relationships to the future partner, often in an unconscious way no matter if healthy or destructive. The good thing about it is, that when we are aware of our patterns we have the power to change them, if they are not beneficial to our wellbeing.

Pass on patterns to the next generation

A lot of people aren’t aware that they pass on their attachment style when they become parents themselves.
Summary

Attachment is a reciprocal and constantly altering process depending on our current phase in life and it affects all of us. It is particularly crucial in the early years when we are most dependent and vulnerable to others. We build our expectations on how people will behave towards us on the experience of relationships we made with our parents, other caregiver and later also our peers. Therefore, it is important that the bonding process is of high quality. Besides, the relationship between child and parent is the foundation for education.

*Note: In this article parent/s can be substituted by the term caregiver, more on that is coming up soon!
