In this article, the couple relationship consists of two people who are in a romantic relationship and have a biological child or children. The parents don’t have to be necessarily married but their relationship is exclusive and intimate.
A little bit of family system theory

### The spillover hypothesis

The Spillover hypothesis proposes that there is an association between two family subsystems. Let’s say one subsystem is the interparental relationship and the other subsystem is the parent-child interaction. Now, if a conflict occurs between the parents with a negative impact on e. g. the mood than the child-parent interaction will be negatively influenced by this parental conflict.

### The compensation hypothesis

The compensation hypothesis is the opposite of the spillover hypothesis. Deficits in one subsystem will be compensated by seeking satisfaction in another subsystem. For example, couple dissatisfaction is compensated with increased investment in child-rearing.
Parental couple conflict and the impact on parenting

It is well known, that conflicts between couples can have a negative influence on parenting (spillover). Hereby, the type of conflict plays a role. Examples for parental conflicts are hostile interactions, withdrawal or violence. The type of conflict can be an indicator of abnormal child behavior.

Hostile interactions, for example, result in more externalizing behavior in children whereas withdrawal from the parental conflict leads to internalizing difficulties. If the negative behavior is external or internal depends on the parent (mother or father) who rejects parenting.

Violence between parents is a severe stressor for children, no matter if they are direct witnesses or not. Physical aggression between parents is associated with harsh parenting or physical abuse towards the child. Children who experience intimate partner violence (IVP) and harsh discipline parenting show externalizing symptoms. However, one study found a positive association between IVP and effective parenting (compensation). Nevertheless, most of the literature supports the spillover hypothesis.

### Summary

We can agree that the side effects of destructive conflicts are crucial to children’s wellbeing. The spillover of negative behavior to parenting takes its toll on children. Children suffer when their parents suffer and it even gets worse when parents aren’t able to regulate their stress appropriately due to marital problems. So, what can be done to improve the lives of children? There are many parenting programs, classes and courses out there, which are absolute eligible and helpful.  But they focus on parenting. To get to the root of trouble we should promote in fact couple therapy or couple counseling before problems take over. There, parents learn to communicate better in stressful situations, develop strategies to support each other and get a better understanding of their own limits. All that can be experienced in a safe framework with a professional. Many people don’t see the necessity for “therapy” or “counseling” when everything seems alright. Therefore, it would be advisable to offer couple support as natural as parenting workshops or birthing classes. In the end, everyone benefits from that.

*Limitation: this article focuses on at least one biological parent and does not include studies conducted within the LGBTQ-community, as far as I am aware. Big sorry and I see the relevance of that. At this point, I can’t make a statement about whether there is valuable research available or not in this area.
