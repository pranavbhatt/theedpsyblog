In mid-November, I had the opportunity to attend a seminar about children’s peer culture and sociodramatic play of children at [Bing Nursery School](https://bingschool.stanford.edu/), Stanford. The seminar was held in the beautiful facilities of the preschool and started with bagels and coffee. In this warm atmosphere, I enjoyed a very informative and insightful seminar.

In this blog post I summarized the key insights for you.

### Peer Culture

Why do children play? The answer to this question often is, that they have a lot of energy, they want to have fun or they play to learn. This is certainly true, but there is more.

Through “let’s pretend”- play children create their own peer culture. They slip into different roles, live out different characters, push their and other’s boundaries and process past experiences. In a peer culture routine, values, concerns and interaction with peers are shared. As human beings, children have the desire to belong and engage. These desires are fulfilled through play.

### Play Community

The play community consists of a familiar group of children who play together. They share actions, scripts, meanings and establish individual as well as collective routines through play.

The peer culture defines the characteristics of the play community. These characteristics determine the play. They include rules, order and time, shared knowledge, interconnected and shared events, roles and control.

### Rules

Children’s rules include actions, objects, players, and words. They repeat these components in a clear and consistent way during play. Children know how to play their specific role.

For example, they play firefighter. Children are familiar with the job of a firefighter and they know the tools of firefighters. Thus, they will extinguish fire with water within their play.

### Roles

The roles each child plays reflect an individual as well as a collective reality. Children grow up in specific environments. They observe everyone around them closely. Relationships and people’s behavior are of special interest for children. They absorb every information they get through interactions with other people but also through books and media. In a play the roles can reflect everyday experiences. Roles can be second hand (e.g. role of a police officer) or they can be a result of their vivid fantasy (e.g. fairies).

### Shared Knowledge

Children in a play community share an understanding of their roles. Even if children are not familiar with a specific topic they can read the play and they adapt their behavior to the role.

### Control

In a play children demonstrate control and ownership. The dominant role (e.g. the mother) decides what the other players (e.g. children) should do.

### Order and time

The play takes place in a consistent setting over time. It occurs ordered and sequential.

### Interconnected and shared events

A play community can integrate another play community when they share common interests, have a good communication and a cooperative social interaction style.

### The teacher’s role

It may seem that teachers are not needed or may even interrupt the play. Nevertheless, they can assist the children in a supportive way. Jones & Reynolds (2015) suggest six roles of the teacher:

(1) the stage manager, who provides materials and gives time for uninterrupted play,
(2) the mediator, who helps to communicate or to solve conflicts,
(3) the player, who starts or extends the play,
(4) the scribe, who shares back with children,
(5) the assessor & communicator, who observes the situation and responds appropriately,
(6) the planner, who knows the player and environment.

### My take home message

Thanks to the seminar I gained a better understanding of the complexity and importance of children’s play. I learned about the meaning of peer culture, the characteristics of peer community and the role of the teacher.

The lecturers emphasized that children obtain social literacies through play. Children practice how to read social situations in order to participate. Thus, they develop an understanding of social behavior and cultural rules. They learn how to sustain and protect a play via collaboration, conflict resolution skills, and leading and following. They experience an exclusive sense of “we” by avoiding intruders.

In addition, they gain personal skills like self-control, self-direction and self-regulation. They practice communication and cooperation. These skills and abilities are essential to function successfully in a society. The foundation is established in early childhood, especially in sociodramatic play with our peers.

Thank you [Bing Nursery School](https://bingschool.stanford.edu/) for an informative and fun Saturday morning.
