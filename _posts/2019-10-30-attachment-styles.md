### The 4 attachment styles in children

The first person who measured attachment was developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth. She developed a procedure, called the strange situation, where she observed the relationship between caregiver and child. The setting was designed as followed: children will be separated for a short time from their parent, which is a stressful situation for a little child.<!--more--> Few minutes later the caregiver enters the room again. The researchers were interested in how children behave during the separation situation and how they behave when caregiver and child reunite. These experiments were replicated multiple times and with different primary caregivers. As a result of these experiments, researchers identified four patterns of attachment. Here are the following patterns:


Secure

Securely attached children may show distress when their parent leaves the room but when the parent comes back they are happy and welcome her. The relationship between parent and child is strong. The child knows that he/she can rely on the adult, that the adult helps the child to meet his/her physical and emotional needs. Therefore, the child sees the parent as a secure island where the child can come back to anytime for comfort. This teaches the child how to regulate his/her emotions. The parent who establishes a secure attachment is attuned to the child’s needs and models how to cope with difficult inner feelings and how to cope feelings in a relationship.

Children with secure relationship models are not afraid to explore the world. They develop strong self-esteem, act more independent and have good self-reliance. They learn the ability to easily engage in relationships. Their school performance is better and they experience less anxiety and depression.

Insecure – anxious

Children who are anxiously attached might show anxious behavior towards strangers. They are highly distressed when their mother/father leaves the room. The distress does not instantly decline when the parent returns.

This attachment can be a result of parents who don’t put their children’s needs first, e.g. the mother is not feeling well at the same time the child has a need, but instead of caring for the child first, the mother takes care of herself. These children show an ambivalent behavior towards the parent which is a response to the unpredictability to the responsiveness of the parent. Simply said, when the parent is in a good mood the child’s needs are met instantly but this does not apply when the parent is in a bad mood. These children learn that only when everyone is in a happy state they can be happy too.

The insecure – anxious attachment is also called ambivalent attachment. Another attribution is the term anxious-resistant attachment.

Insecure – avoidant

Children with an avoidant attachment style show almost no reaction towards their caregiver. Even though it is a stressful situation for them when the parent leaves the room they stay quiet from the outside. They show the same behavior upon reunion.

It is assumed that the caregiver of a child with this attachment style, is not available for the child and thus, doesn’t meet the child’s needs adequately and on a frequent basis. These children are basically left alone with their emotions and they have to figure out how to deal and cope with stressful situations on their own. They learn that there is no one to rely on but themselves.

Disorganized/disoriented

Disorganized or disoriented attached children often show a confusing behavior because the parent can be experienced as comforting and/or as fearful. They tend to avoid the parent after they return. Sometimes they are even hitting the parent.

This attachment style is associated with abusive or neglecting caregivers. The child does not feel safe but also has no other choice then staying with the caregiver no matter how traumatizing the situations might be.
Summary

We learn from our early experiences with our caregivers how to cope with stress and stressful environments. Our caregivers are our guides to who we look up to for comfort and help. They model for us how relationships look like and how emotions are communicated in relationships. They teach us consciously or unconsciously how to deal with our inner world. Based on all the data we collect during this time we build our image on how we have to behave to get what we want and what we can expect from other people. An anxious attached child can turn into a person, who tries to please anyone around them in order to relax, an avoidant attached child might become an adult who can’t rely on his future partner and a disoriented attached child might turn into an adult who has trouble to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy relationships.

These are just explanation attempts which underline the importance of the knowledge about attachment in early childhood, because of the long-term effects! This does not mean, that you have to spoil your little one all the time or that there a no arguments allowed. Especially as brand new parent after birth it can be very hard to transition smoothly into parenthood and sometimes mothers don’t feel the bond at all at the beginning (e.g. postpartum depression). But if you know about the impact of attachment and that not only the physical needs of a child are important, but also the emotional ones, you might work on yourself to be the best role model you can be or you will search for professional help, which is absolutely legit.
